1.  If function returns a status, type of that status must be "int", and it must return one of the value from "enum func_status" (see samples.h)
    But if the function returns its output, then error must be written in "errno" variable.

2.  Don't use unsigned char, short, int, long long, etc where you need exact length, these types vary from the system.
    Use uint8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t, etc instead.

3.  For samples use slevel_t, because all functions, that are using it, are independent of slevel_t root type. (*)
    (*) There's only one restriction - root type of slevel_t must be signed integer type.

4.  Don't base your code on that the slevel_t is always 32-bit wide. It may not be.
    Write your code so, that it's not dependent of slevel_t root type.
    See "samples.h" for macros, that will help you to do it.

5.  Use malloc, calloc, realloc with casting to needed type (it's necessary for compatibility with C++).

6.  All external functions declarations must begin with "CFUNCTION" macro.
    If C++ compiler is used, it avoids C++ name mangling.

7.  Functions, that use OpenMP should work without enabling OpenMP (it's necessary for
    compatibility with compilers, that don't support OpenMP).

8.  Some abbreviations are allowed. If you using them, then you have to specify them here.
    Abbreviations, that you can see in the code:
        > og - original
        > cha - channel(s)
        > val - value
        > fmt - format(s)
        > freq - frequency
        > lut - lookup table
